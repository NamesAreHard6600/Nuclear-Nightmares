Into the Breach Squad: Nuclear Nightmares 1.1.0
By: NamesAreHard
A lot of the amazing Art: Machin
Contact me on discord via the Into The Breach server or @NamesAreHard#2501 for bug reports,
balance problems, or whatever else, I'd love to see what you've done with my squad.

Side Note: If you somehow have a hold on this and you're using it for an example for your own mod, don't,
the code is such a mess. Use tosx's or Lemon's.
